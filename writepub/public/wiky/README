Wiky Editor - a Javascript library that turns a textarea into a Wiki markup editor
=======================

Introduction
-------------------
Wiky Editor - a Javascript library that turns a textarea into a Wiki markup editor.
There are 2 libraries:

1. wiky_base_editor.js
    an editor that supports an undo/redo mechanism, which is better than a default undo/redo mechanism of a browser. 
    My undo/redo mechanism saves a history record when:
      - Ctrl+V = Pasting is performed
      - Ctrl+* = Other action, e.g. make bold or italic
      - New-line is performed.
      
    An undo/redo from a browser only saves a history record when the textarea is unfocused, in which case, it is not enough in my opinion.

2. wiky_editor.js
   An editor that inherits wiky_base_editor and further supports shortcut for Wiki markup feature. Below are what it supports:
     - Ctrl+B = toggle bold
     - Ctrl+I = toggle italic
     - Ctrl+h = toggle heading
     - You can have toolbar for adding links, videos and images
