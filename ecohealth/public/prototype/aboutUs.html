<p>The ecosystem approach to human health is based on the belief that ecosystems and human livelihood are interconnected; i.e., human health is affected 
by ecosystem change. By maintaining and improving our environment, we improve human health and well-being in a sustainable way, which in turn 
contributesto ecological sustainability.</p>
<p>In order to promote the application of ecohealth approaches, there is an urgent need for capacity-building, knowledge generation, leadership 
development and global networking in the field of ecohealth.</p>
<p>Asia is the most rapidly developing region in the world and home to the greatest concentration of cultural and biological diversity. At the same time, 
regional environmental change is occurring at a historically rapid rate, creating vulnerable populations and ecosystems, and contributing to the global hotspot 
of emerging infectious diseases. The idea of establishing an EcoHealth Network was developed from the WHO/TDR-IDRC-funded multi-country initiative: 
"Eco-Bio-Social (EBS) Research on Dengue in Asia" that involved 6 Asian countries, i.e., India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. 
One of the outcomes from that initiative was the desire to maintain interaction and collaboration among the investigators, which could be extended to 
other infectious diseases. During the development of the IDRC-EcoEID Research Project, the Asian EBS Network was extended to include members from 
Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam. The membership was then later extended to Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Singapore; 
the total number to date is 17 countries.</p>
<p>The "EcoHealth Network" was officially launched at the 1st EcoHealth Network Meeting in Koh Chang, Thailand, 29-31 January, 2011, and was 
attended by representatives of 15 countries.</p>

<p>The EcoHealth Network is a non-profit, non-political scientific and educational entity whose mission is to develop and coordinate a strong network of 
committed individuals and institutions that will facilitate the sustainable establishment of integrative programs aimed at improving the health of people and

										Scope:
									</span>
									<span class="span-88 content_indent margin-top-1 margin-bottom-1 margin-left-1 medium_dark_gray font12 display_block">
<p>The EcoHealth Network is composed of individuals, institutes and organisations from various disciplines who are involved in integrative ecohealth 
activities through education, research, training, advocacy, policy, etc. It is a community with the particularly common mission of promoting public health.</p>
<p>The EcoHealth Network will serve as a forum and platform for information and resource sharing, research capacity strengthening and research 
collaboration. Our areas of research cover topics that are related to how changes in ecosystems (composed of ecological, biological and social situations) 
could impact human health, in particular with regards to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. This research strives to provide innovative, practical 
and realistic solutions that will reduce or reverse the negative impacts of ecosystem change.  Therefore, the ways in which the network plans to liaise with 
professional and scientific associations could play an important role in maximizing the benefits of activities of mutual interest and building positive synergy 
around innovative ideas and good practices via customized social networks.</p>
