Version 1.0.6:
  - Fixed a bug (reported by Curtis Schofield) that led to
    problems with empty elements that had only attributes.

Version 1.0.5:
  - Corrected version info in INSTALL file.

Version 1.0.4:
  - Fixed small bug in install.rb.

Version 1.0.3:
  - Works with Ruby 1.8.0 and current REXML now.

Version 1.0.2:
  - All objects can be encoded now by value_to_xml. The Perl
    version excluded blessed references, but in Ruby each
    object has a to_s method, so this restriction wasn't
    necessary. Thanx to Daniel Wu for "pointing" this out.

Version 1.0.1:
  - Removed a bug (reported by Paul DuBois) that led to a
    warning in XmlSimple.initialize.

Version 1.0.0:
  - Added three caching models.
  - Option names are case insensitive now and underscores
    are no longer significant, i.e.
      force_array == ForceArray == forcearray == fOR__CEArray
  - 'force_array' option additionally works with regexes
    now.
  - Added 'indent' option that allows to specify an
    arbitrary string to be used for indentation by
    xml_out.
  - Added 'GroupTags' option.
  - Added 'Variables' option.
  - Added 'VarAttr' option.
  - Added 'NormaliseSpace' option.
  - Added 'NoIndent' option.

Version 0.6.0:
  - First working version.
