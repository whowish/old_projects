			How it Works
		</span>
		<ol class="fontsize12 medium_gray">
			<li> After accepting the application, enter the name of your college in the pop-up box. This will take you to your university's or college's swap page. If there are no items listed, get the action going by being the first to post what you have and want to swap!
			</li><br />
			<li>
				Click "Stuff I Want" on the top menu bar to add a product or service that you want. Click "Stuff I Can Trade" to add a product or service that you have to swap. When you post, click "Share on my wall" to let your friends know what you want and got to swap!
			</li><br />
			<li>
				You can now start making swap requests with others. You can also make and accept buying offers if a swap match can't be made. Keep track of all your requests and swaps by viewing your "Inbox".
	
			</li><br />
			<li>
				Once a swap is accepted. Use Facebook's private message feature to make meeting arrangements.
			</li><br />
			<li>
				That's about it! We've tried to make the whole process pretty intuitive. If we have left anything out or you would like us to add a new feature to CollegeSwap please click the "request features" button at the bottom of the application. There is also a button there for reporting any bugs or glitches.
			</li><br />
			<li>
				Thanks for using CollegeSwap!

					What if I don't see my college/university listed?

					What if I don't see a category for my listing?
				</span><br />
				<span class="medium_gray">
					Remember that the Books category covers all kinds of textbooks, books, and e-books; Toys covers all electronics, gadgets, and fun stuff; Crib covers everything related to your house or dorm room; and Services covers everything from tutoring to car rides home. If your listing doesn't fit into one of those 4 categories, then place it in Everything Else.

				<span class="bold_font ">
					What if I have a problem with the item I swapped for?
				</span><br />
				<span class="medium_gray">
					For maximum protection CollegeSwap suggests that you swap with friends and or friends of friends. We are also working on a rating system, where you can rate the person you swapped with and let others know if you have had a bad experience.

				<span class="bold_font ">
					What should I do if the application seems to malfunction?
				</span><br />
				<span class="medium_gray">
					Click on the "report bugs" button at the bottom of the application and let us know what operating system you are using, what internet browser, and what problem you are experiencing. We will try to get all problems worked out quickly.

			</li><br />
			<li>
				<span class="bold_font ">
					I am not in college. Can I still use CollegeSwap?
				</span><br />
				<span class="medium_gray">
					Sure. If you live near a college campus, you could enter that as your college. Or if you want to swap with your friends on Facebook who aren't college students, you could enter "College of Hard Knocks" as your college and filter the results by your friends only.
